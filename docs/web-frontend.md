# The Web Frontend

Faaso Comes with a web-based frontend for simple
administrative tasks. While not necessary, it can
be handy.

Once you have [configured your FaaSO server](server-setup.html) you can access it by visiting the URL of your server in a web browser.

The default username is `admin` and the password is the one you configured yourself.

The web frontend is a simple interface that allows you to:

* Start/Stop funkos
* See their status, whether they are up to date or stale
* If they are healthy or not
* See logs
* Access a terminal session
* Add, remove and edit secrets
